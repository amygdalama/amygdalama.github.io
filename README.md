This repo houses the static HTML for my website, mathamy.com. 

For more information on how I set up my website using GitHub Pages and Pelican, see this [blog post](http://mathamy.com/migrating-to-github-pages-using-pelican.html).

Most commit messages just say "automatic commit". That is because I have Git Hooks set up to automatically add, commit, and push the content in this repository any time I push to my [blog-source](https://github.com/amygdalama/blog-source) repo, which contains my source Markdown files for my blog posts, my Pelican configuration files, and my customized theme. For more information on how I set up the Git Hook, consult [this](http://mathamy.com/github-pages-publication-git-hooks.html) blog post.
