  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>For the past four months I've been using Anaconda's Python distribution
on my Macbook, which has been great (except for <a href="http://mathamy.com/2013/12/02/homebrew-path-pythonpath/">Part 1</a> of what has
now become a series), until I wanted to play with virtualenv. Apparently
Anaconda does not work well with virtualenv and suggests using its own
conda virtual environments and I don't take well to The Man telling me I
can't do something I want to do. So of course my reaction was to
<code>rm -rf /anaconda</code>.</p>
<p>Now I'm building my Python stack back from the ground up, and I've
decided to try out a <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/wiki/Homebrew-and-Python">brewed</a> Python. I've been following <a href="http://www.lowindata.com/2013/installing-scientific-python-on-mac-os-x/">these</a>
very elegant instructions to set up numpy, scipy, etc, on OSX, and it
worked flawlessly! Until matplotlib! I had all of the dependencies
(freetype, which I installed via Homebrew, zlib, and libpng), but I kept
getting thrown this error:</p>
<p>[code gutter="false"]fatal error: 'freetype/config/ftheader.h' file not
found</p>
<p>#include \&lt;freetype/config/ftheader.h>[/code]</p>
<p>I finally found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1477144/compile-matplotlib-for-python-on-snow-leopard">this</a> StackOverflow discussion with the suggestion to
type this into the terminal (for brewed python):</p>
<p>[code gutter="false"]\$ ln -s /usr/local/include/freetype2/
/usr/include/freetype[/code]</p>
<p>And then <code>sudo pip install matplotlib</code> worked! I don't rigorously
understand this magic, but based on my research this creates a 'symbolic
link' from <code>/usr/include/freetype</code> to <code>/usr/local/include/freetype2</code>
(the brewed freetype). I'm guessing that matplotlib by default was
looking for freetype in <code>/usr/include/freetype</code>, but it wasn't there
since Homebrew installs everything in <code>/usr/local</code>. So, creating the
symbolic link allowed matplotlib to find freetype. In moments like these
I'm like 'Yer a wizard, Harry.'</p>
