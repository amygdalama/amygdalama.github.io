<p>Things I'm happy with:
<em> I had made some last minute changes, adding the tic tac toe example and the explanations involving code objects and bytecode. I received positive feedback on each of these additions, so I think I made the right choice. The part I liked most is that these added some threads that curious people could pull on to learn more.
</em> At least half the audience got at least one trivia question wrong! Which means they learned something!
<em> My explanations clear, rigorous, and fun!
</em> Some people asked questions! I'm assuming this means they found the topic interesting!
<em> The first question I got during the Q&amp;A wasn't a question, and instead was a claim that I said something incorrect. Many people have given me positive feedback on how I handled that situation. My response was, in Allison Kaptur's words, "inviting, informative, and authoritative."
</em> I admitted I didn't know an answer to a question! I'm proud of myself for being brave enough to admit this and for setting an example that Not Knowing Everything is totally okay.
<em> Ned Batchelder gave me a shoutout during his talk!
</em> I was comfortable enough to watch the video shortly after my talk, and I'm really happy with it!
* I didn't use any words I've been trying to eliminate from my vocabulary ("crazy" is one that I was worried about in particular)!</p>
<p>Things I hope to get better at:
<em> I'd like to give a more advanced talk.
</em> I keep comparing myself to people who have given many Python talks, have been programming much longer than I have, etc, and I should stop that.
<em> Pause and drink water between sections/examples.
</em> Figure out what makes some talks more popular than others. My talk didn't have the turnout I was hoping for, and I'm not sure why or how to get better at that yet.</p>
