    <p>I have to admit day 1 of Hacker School was fairly overwhelming for me.
With so many amazing people to talk to and interesting projects to
collaborate on I felt a bit like:</p>
<p><a href="http://mathamy.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/allthetennisballs.gif"><img alt="allthetennisballs" src="http://mathamy.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/allthetennisballs.gif" /></a></p>
<p><em>(Credit to Hacker School alumnus Alex Beaulne for finding this perfect
gif.)</em></p>
<p>In an attempt to regain a bit of sanity, yesterday I prioritized setting
goals for the batch and creating a semi-pubic to-do list. I also began
maintaining a list of learnings about how I can better approach Hacker
School and learning in general. My to-do list, goals, and learnings can
be found on my <a href="https://github.com/amygdalama/hacker-school-progress">GitHub</a>, which I'll be updating at least daily.</p>
<p>In order to determine my goals, I answered the following questions, to
ensure that what I set out to accomplish aligned with my values and my
motivations for attending Hacker School. These lists are ranked somewhat
by importance, but probably aren't perfectly ordered.</p>
<p><strong><em>What do I want to get out of Hacker School?</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Greater confidence, honesty, self-awareness, bravery</li>
<li>Gain expertise in Python, Data Analysis, Machine Learning (currently
    beginner-/intermediate-level)</li>
<li>Join a community of programmers/math nerds who will help motivate me
    to achieve greatness</li>
<li>Frankly, a job</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>What do I want to accomplish at Hacker School?</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height:1.5em;">One large (1-month) project which
    requires pulling data from many sources and applying a recommender
    system, probably to recommend an optimal brunch spot for me, because
    brunch is awesome. This idea is inspired by </span>[Hilary
    Mason][]<span style="line-height:1.5em;">.</span></li>
<li>A plethora of varying, small (1-day) analysis and machine learning
    projects</li>
<li>Blog posts galore (3-5 per week) with a focus on writing
    tutorials/explaining benefits of various packages</li>
<li>A successful pull request, contributing to an open source project or
    an existing tutorial</li>
<li>Create a Python package (maybe with functions based on Jaynes'
    <em>Probability Theory: The Logic of Science</em>)</li>
<li>Give a talk! (eeeep!)</li>
<li>Revamped website possibly using Pelican/GitHub pages (nonessential,
    not a priority)</li>
<li>Murdered out GitHub account (a pleasant side effect of all of the
    above)</li>
</ul>
