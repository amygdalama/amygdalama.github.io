With so many amazing people to talk to and interesting projects to
collaborate on I felt a bit like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt text" src="http://amygdalama.github.io/images/allthetennisballs.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Credit to Hacker School alumnus Alex Beaulne for finding this perfect
gif.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to regain a bit of sanity, yesterday I prioritized setting
goals for the batch and creating a semi-pubic to-do list. I also began
maintaining a list of learnings about how I can better approach Hacker
School and learning in general. My to-do list, goals, and learnings can
be found on my &lt;a href="https://github.com/amygdalama/hacker-school-progress"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, which I'll be updating at least daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to determine my goals, I answered the following questions, to
ensure that what I set out to accomplish aligned with my values and my
motivations for attending Hacker School. These lists are ranked somewhat
by importance, but probably aren't perfectly ordered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-do-i-want-to-get-out-of-hacker-school"&gt;What do I want to get out of Hacker School?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greater confidence, honesty, self-awareness, bravery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gain expertise in Python, Data Analysis, Machine Learning (currently
    beginner-/intermediate-level)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join a community of programmers/math nerds who will help motivate me
    to achieve greatness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frankly, a job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-do-i-want-to-accomplish-at-hacker-school"&gt;What do I want to accomplish at Hacker School?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One large (1-month) project which
    requires pulling data from many sources and applying a recommender
    system, probably to recommend an optimal brunch spot for me, because
    brunch is awesome. This idea is inspired by &lt;a href="http://www.hilarymason.com/presentations-2/in-search-of-the-optimal-cheeseburger/"&gt;Hilary Mason&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A plethora of varying, small (1-day) analysis and machine learning
    projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blog posts galore (3-5 per week) with a focus on writing
    tutorials/explaining benefits of various packages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A successful pull request, contributing to an open source project or
    an existing tutorial&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a Python package (maybe with functions based on Jaynes'
    &lt;em&gt;Probability Theory: The Logic of Science&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give a talk! (eeeep!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revamped website possibly using Pelican/GitHub pages (nonessential,
    not a priority)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Murdered out GitHub account (a pleasant side effect of all of the
    above)&lt;/li&gt;
