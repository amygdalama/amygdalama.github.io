&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ask them about it, maybe they know things you don't know&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;change the subject&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;say something nice, like "I like your hat"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don't do or say anything&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;excuse yourself from the conversation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use this moment to grow as a person&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;say "oh, how interesting" even though you don't think it's interesting, while secretly judging them because you are clearly smarter and more experienced and knowledgeable than they are&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tell them what you really think, which is that you're clearly smarter and more experienced and knowledgeable than they are, because you read this one article on HN that said that this technology they use fucking sucks, and then, mid-sentence, have a rare moment of reflection in which you realize that your feelings of superiority aren't relevant to the conversation at hand, and that maybe you could &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; go around making other people feel bad about themselves in order to make yourself feel better all the time, and maybe this compulsion you have to assert dominance is actually due to your own self consciousness and fear&lt;/li&gt;
