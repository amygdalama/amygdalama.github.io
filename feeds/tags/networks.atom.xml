the Rfacebook package, I decided to try it out on my own group of
friends, to see if my social circles are clique-y ala &lt;a href="https://raw2.github.com/amygdalama/amygdalama.github.io/master/images/nshs.jpg"&gt;North Shore High
School&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alt text" src="https://raw2.github.com/amygdalama/amygdalama.github.io/master/images/fb-network.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out the social circles in my network were visualized almost
perfectly! The smallest group to the far right of the graph contains
family members, the large group at the top contains current co-workers,
and the large group at the bottom contains friends in the Austin cyclist
scene. Other clusters are friends from high school, friends from
college, and bar friends. The most isolated group is my family. The
groups with the most connections to each other are my current coworkers,
cyclists, and bar friends, which makes sense, because they are roughly
in the same age group and live (or have lived) in Austin, a fairly
connected city. Now I'm wondering how to get the data to see if Austin
really is more connected than other cities or if it's just in our
collective imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
