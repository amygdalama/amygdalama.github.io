a day spa for programmers, a hippie commune programming cult (okay, that
one was me), not a school, not necessarily for <a href="https://raw2.github.com/amygdalama/amygdalama.github.io/master/images/hackers-movie.jpg">these</a> kind of
Hackers, and more. The Hacker School founders and facilitators have
written extensively about what Hacker School is and is not, so dig into

their blog if you're curious. It's difficult to define, and they do a
much better job than I do.</p>
<p>For the first day, I dedicated a good hour to getting my computer set up
properly (if you've seen my <a href="http://mathamy.com/2013/12/27/wget-sanity-part-2-im-an-idiot-and-decided-to-switch-to-a-brewed-python-and-reinstall-the-scientific-stack-at-10pm/">wget</a> posts, you'll know this
is something I've struggled with in the past). Then I had my first
attempt at pair programming in which I explained a few cool things about
<a href="http://scikit-learn.org/">scikit-learn</a> to another Hacker Schooler who had never used it
before. In turn she showed me some regression modeling in R.</p>
<p>I also got to play with HS's resident Apple II. One of the other Hacker
Schoolers wrote a simple for loop to print out "DONG" 100 times. Why
would you do anything else?</p>

<p>I am supremely honored and excited as Hell to be at Hacker School. For
the next three months, I will be surrounded by intellectually curious
nerds who are more thoughtful and self-aware than most people I know. I
hope I am brave and honest enough to confront the gaps in my knowledge,
ask questions, seek help, and ultimately get the most out of what will
be some of the most formidable months of my life. Which reminds me of
