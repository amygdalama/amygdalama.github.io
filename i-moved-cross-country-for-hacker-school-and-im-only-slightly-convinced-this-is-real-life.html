</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Or, Hacker School: Day 1.</p>
<p>Holy Shit! I have been fairly silent over the past month because I got
accepted to <a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/">Hacker School</a> and had to figure out the logistics of
quitting my job, moving cross-country, and living in the most expensive
city in the States without a proper job for at least 3 months.</p>
<p>So allow me to re-iterate: Holy Shit! And somehow I did it and I'm alive
but not entirely certain it's not all just a dream.</p>
<p>Today was the first day of a possibly insane but probably brilliant
adventure. Hacker School is self-described as a writers' retreat for
programmers. I've heard other Hacker Schoolers struggle to explain it as
a day spa for programmers, a hippie commune programming cult (okay, that
one was me), not a school, not necessarily for <a href="https://raw2.github.com/amygdalama/amygdalama.github.io/master/images/hackers-movie.jpg">these</a> kind of
Hackers, and more. The Hacker School founders and facilitators have
written extensively about what Hacker School is and is not, so dig into
their blog if you're curious. It's difficult to define, and they do a
much better job than I do.</p>
<p>For the first day, I dedicated a good hour to getting my computer set up
properly (if you've seen my <a href="http://mathamy.com/2013/12/27/wget-sanity-part-2-im-an-idiot-and-decided-to-switch-to-a-brewed-python-and-reinstall-the-scientific-stack-at-10pm/">wget</a> posts, you'll know this
is something I've struggled with in the past). Then I had my first
attempt at pair programming in which I explained a few cool things about
<a href="http://scikit-learn.org/">scikit-learn</a> to another Hacker Schooler who had never used it
before. In turn she showed me some regression modeling in R.</p>
<p>I also got to play with HS's resident Apple II. One of the other Hacker
Schoolers wrote a simple for loop to print out "DONG" 100 times. Why
would you do anything else?</p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="https://raw2.github.com/amygdalama/amygdalama.github.io/master/images/appleiidong.jpg" /></p>
<p>I am supremely honored and excited as Hell to be at Hacker School. For
the next three months, I will be surrounded by intellectually curious
nerds who are more thoughtful and self-aware than most people I know. I
hope I am brave and honest enough to confront the gaps in my knowledge,
ask questions, seek help, and ultimately get the most out of what will
be some of the most formidable months of my life. Which reminds me of
the Bene Gesserit litany:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death
that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it
to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past me I will
turn to see fears path. Where the fear has gone there will be
nothing... Only I will remain.</em></p>
