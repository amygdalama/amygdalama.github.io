<p>Amy is what I would call a professional badass. I was lucky
enough to have Amy as a teacher, mentor, coworker and friend while
working together at Adlucent. In everything she does, Amy is extremely
thorough, thoughtful, intelligent, patient and strategic. I would
honestly say that Amy is one of the most valued resources at our
company and I couldn't recommend her more highly.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align:right">- Aly Collins</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Amy has a knack for seeing how things are connected and fit into the
'big picture'.  If she discovers a better way to do things in her
day-to-day work, she has the curiosity and the initiative
to see if anyone else on the team could benefit from her discovery.
 She looks at processes holistically and thinks big to see where she
can have the most impact.  She is driven to produce results, and is
one of those people who genuinely cares about making her mark on the
organization.  She is consistently authentic in her
communication and speaks up when something doesn't seem right to her.
 There's no BS with Amy, yet she manages to be this way in an
open-minded and empathetic manner.  I highly recommend working with
her if you have the opportunity!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align:right">- Kara Kalasky</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Amy will succeed wherever she goes because she has strong
quantitative analytical skills and the rare ability to both
recognize what needs to be done and then carry it out to completion.</p>
<p>She's the person you can rely on to provide reasoned solutions and to
think critically about the processes that serve the objective,
always looking to improve them.</p>
<p>The greatest thing about working with Amy is that she has her eye on
the success of the organization as a whole. She looks for systematic
opportunities to make the work better and smarter. Best of all, she is
willing to help where help is needed. Amy is generous with her
time and knowledge, and improves the work of those around her.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align:right">- Michelle Hinojosa    </h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Amy is one of the smartest, mostfocused, andhighly
driven people I have met. All while staying grounded and not taking
herself too seriously. Plus, she plays a mean game of foosball.</p>
