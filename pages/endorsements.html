<p>Amy is what I would call a professional badass. I was lucky
enough to have Amy as a teacher, mentor, coworker and friend while
working together at Adlucent. In everything she does, Amy is extremely
thorough, thoughtful, intelligent, patient and strategic. I would
honestly say that Amy is one of the most valued resources at our

day-to-day work, she has the curiosity and the initiative
to see if anyone else on the team could benefit from her discovery.
 She looks at processes holistically and thinks big to see where she

one of those people who genuinely cares about making her mark on the
organization.  She is consistently authentic in her
