Hi, I'm Amy.
===============
After much internal struggle, I've finally convinced myself I can
identify as A Programmer. My current focus is becoming an expert in
Python, Machine Learning, and Data Analysis. I have quite a ways to go.

My background is in Theoretical Math. After college I spent a year
optimizing paid search ads for Adam & Eve, so I basically used to sell
dildos on the internet (though my employer was [Adlucent][], an agency).
I then used scikit-learn to automate tasks like
classification of search queries into product categories. Somehow I
wound up quitting my job in Austin and moving to New York for [Hacker
School][] this February.

I nerd out about sex toys, science fiction, feminism, comics, Dune (I
<3 Dune. Dune, Dune, Dune.), math, board games, etc. I think it's fabulous to drink champagne in bed.
