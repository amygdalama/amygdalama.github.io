> to see if anyone else on the team could benefit from her discovery.
>  She looks at processes holistically and thinks big to see where she
> can have the most impact.  She is driven to produce results, and is
> one of those people who genuinely cares about making her mark on the

> communication and speaks up when something doesn't seem right to her.
>  There's no BS with Amy, yet she manages to be this way in an
> open-minded and empathetic manner.  I highly recommend working with
> her if you have the opportunity!
