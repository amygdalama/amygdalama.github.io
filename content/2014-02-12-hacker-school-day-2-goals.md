I have to admit day 1 of Hacker School was fairly overwhelming for me. With so many amazing people to talk to and interesting projects to
collaborate on I felt a bit like:

In an attempt to regain a bit of sanity, yesterday I prioritized setting
goals for the batch and creating a semi-pubic to-do list. I also began
maintaining a list of learnings about how I can better approach Hacker
School and learning in general. My to-do list, goals, and learnings can
be found on my [GitHub], which I'll be updating at least daily.

In order to determine my goals, I answered the following questions, to
ensure that what I set out to accomplish aligned with my values and my
motivations for attending Hacker School. These lists are ranked somewhat
by importance, but probably aren't perfectly ordered.

###What do I want to get out of Hacker School?###

* Greater confidence, honesty, self-awareness, bravery
* Gain expertise in Python, Data Analysis, Machine Learning (currently
    beginner-/intermediate-level)
* Join a community of programmers/math nerds who will help motivate me
    to achieve greatness
* Frankly, a job

###What do I want to accomplish at Hacker School?###

* One large (1-month) project which
    requires pulling data from many sources and applying a recommender
    system, probably to recommend an optimal brunch spot for me, because
    brunch is awesome. This idea is inspired by [Hilary Mason]
* A plethora of varying, small (1-day) analysis and machine learning
    projects
* Blog posts galore (3-5 per week) with a focus on writing
    tutorials/explaining benefits of various packages
* A successful pull request, contributing to an open source project or
    an existing tutorial
* Create a Python package (maybe with functions based on Jaynes'
    *Probability Theory: The Logic of Science*)
* Give a talk! (eeeep!)
* Revamped website possibly using Pelican/GitHub pages (nonessential,
    not a priority)
* Murdered out GitHub account (a pleasant side effect of all of the
    above)
